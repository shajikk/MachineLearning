Dear, 

We are excited your daughter is interested in joining Girl Scouts but noticed you may have gotten stuck. Just Click Here to re-access the Troop Catalog. From there you can search for an open troop within your zip code, grade, and school or community. Space is limited and on a first come first serve basis, so check often and reserve her spot today! 

Once you?ve selected a troop to join, you can complete your girl's membership registration. Once registration is complete, the troop leader will receive your contact information and can reach out with more details. 

If you already know the troop you are joining but don't see it listed on our catalog, select the UNSURE option, once selected click continue and a pop-up box will ask you 'Why are you unsure?' Just let us know the troop number and the name of the leader who has invited you to join.

Don't see an available troop for her grade? No worries, you can start a new troop, or check back with us later on in the Girl Scout year to see if any new troop opportunities have opened up.

Need help? Call us at 800-447-4475 ext 2093 and one of our Member Services Specialists can walk you through the process of selecting a troop near you!
