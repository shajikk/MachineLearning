Support Vector Machines (SVM) 

model= svmTrain(X, y, C, @(x1, x2) gaussianKernel(x1, x2, sigma)); 
predictions = svmPredict(model, Xval);



p = mean(double(predictions ~= yval));
    For classification, the error (p) is defined as the fraction of the 
    cross validation examples that were classified incorrectly. 
    In Octave/MATLAB, we can compute this error using :
          mean(double(predictions ~= yval)), 
    where predictions is a vector containing all the predictions from the SVM, 
    and yval are the true labels from the cross validation set.
